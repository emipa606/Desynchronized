# Mod Description

A continuation of [ClosedDoors](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1315706945) made by MoobyNooby, this mod changes how information spreads among your colonists.

I always find it strange that colonists are able to know things happening basically out of their sight, knowing to an extreme that they can react instantly. ([Descriptive comic by SrGrafo](https://rimworldme.tumblr.com/post/165485304313/innocent-prisoners-of-rimworld)) That's why I decide to take the baton, and finish what has been started: to make information spreading more realistic, and to create the inevitable *desynchronization of understanding*.

With the news-spreading mechanism well-defined and working smoothly across several thousands of colonies galaxy-wide, I present you this question: how much should your pure, innocent colonists know? Should they know everything that has happened in the game, whether big or small, whether bright or dark?

# Features List



- Colonists generally does not react to events that happens "off-map" (i.e. not in the map they are in).
- Colonists have a moderate chance to spread news about past events during chats and talks with each other.
- Colonists may find some news more "important" to themselves; they will be more likely to spread them.
