Mod Description
A continuation of ClosedDoors made by MoobyNooby, this mod changes how information spreads among your colonists.

I always find it strange that colonists are able to know things happening basically out of their sight, knowing to an extreme that they can react instantly. (Descriptive comic by SrGrafo[rimworldme.tumblr.com]) That's why I decide to take the baton, and finish what has been started: to make information spreading more realistic, and to create the inevitable desynchronization of understanding.

With the news-spreading mechanism well-defined and working smoothly across several thousands of colonies galaxy-wide, I present you this question: how much should your pure, innocent colonists know? Should they know everything that has happened in the game, whether big or small, whether bright or dark?

Features List
Visit the GitHub repo for more details, but here are some highlights:
Colonists generally does not react to events that happens "off-map" (i.e. not in the map they are in).
Colonists have a moderate chance to spread news about past events during chats and talks with each other.
Colonists may find some news more "important" to themselves; they will be more likely to spread them.
