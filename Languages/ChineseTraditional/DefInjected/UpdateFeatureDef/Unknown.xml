  <!-- EN: First real update since I took over the mod. A lot of you asks if you can use this to butcher humans in secret. \nWell now you can! I added the butchered humanoid-thought as spreadable news (was not supported before) and I also added an option for room-specific news. \nThat means that with this setting on, only pawns that are in the same room, or in range and has sight (outside) of the event will instantly know of it. Other pawns will have to hear it as news.\nWith this setting off all pawns on the same map had knowledge instantly.\nHope this helps out!\n -->
  <Desynchronized_1_0_2_0.content>这是我接手 MOD 后第一次真正意义上的更新。很多人问我是否可以用这个秘密屠宰人类。
现在可以了！我添加了可传播新闻的屠宰人形思想（以前不支持），还添加了特定房间新闻的选项。
这意味着，在开启此设置后，只有在同一房间内，或在事件范围内并能看到（外部）事件的棋子才能立即知道该事件。其他棋子将不得不把它当作新闻来听。
关闭此设置后，同一张地图上的所有棋子都会立即知晓。
希望对您有所帮助！</Desynchronized_1_0_2_0.content>
