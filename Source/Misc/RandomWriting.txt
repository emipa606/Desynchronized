As your colonists live out their hardy lives out in the Rim, they react to their surrounding world. Joyous news. Suspenseful news. Frightful news.  Tragic news... This gave rise to the numerous dramas that were highly acclaimed not only in the Glitterworlds, but also in the Middleworlds too.

But all such dramas were similar in one single aspect: the characters within them often found it extremely hard to communicate with each other. Be they separated by the vast mountains and deep oceans across the land, or the cold void of spacetime, tales of greatness and loss could never pass through easily.

O Mercy to the Rim! For the jovial travel burdened, yet the dreadful travel light. Mercy to the poor souls on the Rim! For they shall endure the purgatory of life at its full strength, with no hymns of salvation to be heard.
