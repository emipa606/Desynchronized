    <content>First real update since I took over the mod. A lot of you asks if you can use this to butcher humans in secret. 
Well now you can! I added the butchered humanoid-thought as spreadable news (was not supported before) and I also added an option for room-specific news. 
That means that with this setting on, only pawns that are in the same room, or in range and has sight (outside) of the event will instantly know of it. Other pawns will have to hear it as news.
With this setting off all pawns on the same map had knowledge instantly.
Hope this helps out!
